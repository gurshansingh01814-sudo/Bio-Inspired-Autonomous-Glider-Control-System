# Bio-Inspired-Autonomous-Glider-Control-System 
# Project Overview-
         This project implements a fully non-linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) system to enable an autonomous glider to locate, capture, and climb within thermal updraftsâ€”a critical            bio-inspired strategy used by real-world soaring birds. The system successfully demonstrates closed-loop control over a 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) glider model, optimizing lift               coefficient ($\mathbf{C_L}$) and bank angle ($\mathbf{\phi}$) to maximize altitude gain.
# Installation and Setup- 
             This project requires Python and specialized libraries for dynamics, control, and optimization
             Prerequisites 
             All required Python libraries and their versions are listed in requirements.txt
             Setup Instructions
                Clone the repository: git clone [gh repo clone gurshansingh01814-sudo/Bio-Inspired-Autonomous-Glider-Control-System]
                                      cd bio-inspired-autonomous-glider-control
                Install dependencies: Use the provided requirements file : pip install -r requirements.txt
# Running the Simulation-
            Configure the Run-
            Adjust the flight parameters, initial state, and thermal environment in the configuration file:
                                       data/glider_config.yaml: Modify the initial_state, thermal location, and control constraints here.
            Execute the Simulation-
            Run the main simulation loop. The data_logger.py module will automatically record data points at set intervals.
                                       python -m sim.main_simulation
            Generate Results and Plots-
            After the simulation finishes, run the plotting script to visualize the final performance and control decisions.
