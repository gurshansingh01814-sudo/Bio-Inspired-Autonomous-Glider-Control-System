I. Introduction -
        The primary objective of this project is to develop and validate a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for an autonomous glider, focused on thermal soaring. This bio-inspired strategy, mimicking birds like albatrosses and eagles, maximizes flight efficiency by converting atmospheric energy (thermal updrafts) into potential energy (altitude). The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of advanced concepts in non-linear dynamics, optimal control theory, and high-performance numerical computation.
        The chosen approach utilizes a constrained non-linear optimization routine at every control interval to select the optimal lift coefficient ($\mathbf{C_L}$) and bank angle ($\mathbf{\phi}$) that maximizes the anticipated altitude gain over a future time horizon.

II. Mathematical Model and Dynamics-

 A. Glider Dynamics and Integration-
        
 The core of the simulation is a 6-DOF point-mass model for the glider's dynamics, expressed in an Earth-fixed inertial frame $(\mathbf{x, y, z})$.
        
 The state vector is defined as $\mathbf{X} = [x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z]^T$.
        
The control input vector is $\mathbf{U} = [C_L, \phi]^T$.
        
 The equation of motion $\mathbf{\dot{X}} = f(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{W})$ is derived from the sum of three primary forces: Lift ($\mathbf{F_L}$), Drag ($\mathbf{F_D}$), and Gravity ($\mathbf{F_G}$). Drag incorporates the parabolic drag polar: $\mathbf{C_D = C_{D0} + K C_L^2}$.
        
 The continuous-time dynamics are integrated using the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to ensure high numerical accuracy and stability.
        
 B. Atmospheric Model (Thermal Lift)-
    
 The environment includes a stationary, axially symmetric thermal characterized by its center $(\mathbf{x_c}, \mathbf{y_c})$, radius $\mathbf{R}$, and maximum vertical wind speed $\mathbf{W_{z,max}}$. The vertical wind speed ($\mathbf{W_z}$) at any horizontal distance $\mathbf{r}$ from the center is modeled using a simplified conical profile:
                $$\mathbf{W_z}(r) = \mathbf{W_{z,max}} \cdot \max\left(0, 1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)$$

III. Model Predictive Control (MPC) Formulation-

 A. Objective Function-
     
The objective is formulated as a constrained non-linear optimization problem (NLP) solved using the CasADi framework and the Ipopt solver. The cost function $J$ is designed to maximize the final altitude $\mathbf{z_N}$ while minimizing control effort and encouraging proximity to the thermal center.

 $$\min_{\mathbf{U}_k} J = -w_z z_N + w_{dist} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} r_k + w_{\Delta u} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (\Delta C_L^2 + \Delta \phi^2)$$

 B. ConstraintsGlider Dynamics:

 1.The 6-DOF dynamics must be satisfied at every step (Equality Constraint).
        
 2.Control Limits: Bounded physical limits on inputs: $C_{L,min} \leq C_L \leq C_{L,max}$ and $-\phi_{max} \leq \phi \leq \phi_{max}$
        
  3.Altitude Safety: A hard minimum altitude constraint is enforced: $z \geq z_{min}$.
         
IV. Demonstrated Performance (Proof of Concept)-
     The system successfully executed its bio-inspired objective, demonstrating autonomous thermal capture and continuous climb.

V. Possible Real-World Applications (Bio-Inspired Autonomy)-
 
The successful development of the "Bio-Inspired Autonomous Glider Control System" has direct and critical applications in energy-efficient and persistent uncrewed aerial systems (UAS).
      
1. Persistent Surveillance and Environmental Monitoring: 
         
Application- Long-duration, wide-area environmental monitoring, border surveillance, or search and rescue operations where continuous, multi-hour flight is required without refueling.
         
Benefit- By autonomously harvesting energy from thermals, gliders can drastically extend their mission endurance from hours to potentially days, overcoming the primary power limitation of small-scale UAS.
         
2. Planetary Exploration (e.g., Mars)
     
Application: Designing lightweight, autonomous atmospheric probes for planets with significant weather systems, such as Mars.
         
Benefit: On other celestial bodies, where mass limits prohibit large power sources, the ability to use localized atmospheric dynamics (wind, convection) for propulsion is an enabling technology.
         
3. Energy-Efficient Logistics and Delivery
     
Application: Future drone-based delivery systems requiring minimal energy consumption for the longest possible range.
         
Benefit: Integrating thermal-soaring algorithms could make long-distance drone delivery economically viable by reducing battery requirements and leveraging atmospheric energy resources as part of the flight path optimization.

The model provides a foundational framework for designing and testing adaptive, low-power control systems that are essential for the next generation of autonomous vehicles.
